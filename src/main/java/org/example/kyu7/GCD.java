 * Greatest common divisor(7 kyu)
 * Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
 * The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.
 * <p>
 * The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1,
 * so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer
 * that is also greater or equal to 1.
